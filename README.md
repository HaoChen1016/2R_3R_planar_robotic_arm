# Robotic Arm Coding Practice

There is a 2R/3R robot arm trying to reach a randomized goal. 

## Goals
The original version is challenge.py, try to 

* Add walls and obstacles to the world
  * Bonus: make a more easily configurable representation
* Add a third link to the arm
* Make a moving goal
* Improve/Overhaul the graphics or simulation systems (3D, flashier, whatever you want)
* Visualize Paths, Velocities, Accelerations, over time in the sandbox window
  * Note: Not as good to render several separate visualizations
* "Cloudify" gherkin's configuration
* Use a Behavior Tree to make complex behaviors
* Add unit tests and clean up the code (note: don't just do this item!)
* Change system from top down a side view - add gravity!
  * This will require changing Gherkin to use torque control
* Fix sloppy coding
  * We've intentionally left some cruft behind. Bonus points for showing us our mistakes.
